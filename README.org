* Overview
org-weather is a small elisp script for displaying weather data from
openweathermap.org in your org-mode agenda. I wrote this because the
existing package is based on the google api which was discontinued:

https://julien.danjou.info/projects/emacs-packages#google-weather

* Installation
Clone the repository using:

: git clone http://github.com/kautsig/org-weather.git

Add this to your .emacs file:

: ;; Load the org-weather library
: (add-to-list 'load-path "~/<path-to>/org-weather")
: (require 'org-weather)
:
: ;; Set your location and refresh the data
: (setq org-weather-location "London,UK")
: (org-weather-refresh)

Add this to one of your org files:

: * Weather
: %%(org-weather)

When you view your agenda, you should now see the weather for today
and the forecast for next week. You can refresh weather data by
calling:

: M-x org-weather-refresh

* Disclaimer
I'm not a lisp developer and of course you know how to do better. If
so, pull requests are kindly appreciated.
